## 🌗 Automation to switch between day and night theme

- Auto-switch between **day** and **night** themes using the sun entity
- Optional manual override using `input_boolean.theme_override`
- Depending on your setup, I've included example code for both single-file and split configuration.yaml configurations

---

## 📁 Included Files

### 🔄 `Automation - Theme Switch.txt`
Automation that toggles between light and dark themes:
- Follows the sun (`sun.sun`) by default
- Supports override with `input_boolean.theme_override` and `input_boolean.dark_theme`

📌 How to use:

Go to Settings > Automations & Scenes
Click + Create Automation > Click the three dots (⋮) in the top right and select Edit in YAML
Paste the contents of Automation - Theme Switch.txt
Click Save


### ⚙️ `configuration.yaml`
If you're using a monolithic YAML setup:
- Includes theme definitions (`day`, `night`, and `day_and_night`)
- Adds the `input_boolean` definitions needed for manual override

### 🧠 `Input-boolean_dark_theme-overwrite.yaml`
For users with a split YAML setup (`!include_dir_merge_named`):
- Contains the two input booleans:
  - `input_boolean.dark_theme`
  - `input_boolean.theme_override`

### 🎨 `themes_day_night.yaml`
For users who split their themes into a separate file:
- Contains both **light** and **dark** theme definitions
- Includes an optional `day_and_night` theme with dual-mode support

## 🧠 Tip
If you’re not seeing theme changes apply on all devices, make sure each browser or app is set to use the “Home Assistant” theme in its display settings and select mode to 'Auto' for mobile phones & tablets, 'Light' for PCs
